## Project Overview

The Microloan Approval and Risk Evaluation System is a PL/SQL-driven database solution designed for private businesses offering microloans. It automates borrower management, loan processing, risk scoring, and repayment tracking, supporting small-scale entrepreneurs, farmers, and individuals who need quick and reliable financing to grow their activities.

## Problem Statement:

Small private lenders often struggle with slow loan evaluations, inconsistent approval criteria, and weak monitoring due to manual processes. This project solves that problem by introducing an automated, data-driven system that evaluates risk, approves loans, and tracks repayments efficiently and transparently.

## Key Objectives:

* Maintain structured borrower records

* Process loan applications and validate eligibility

* Automate risk evaluation using PL/SQL procedures

* Manage loan disbursements and repayment schedules

* Enforce data integrity using constraints, triggers, and validations

* Provide reliable reporting for business decision-making
